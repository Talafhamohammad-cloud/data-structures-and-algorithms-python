# Hashtables
A hash table (hash map) is a data structure in computing that implements an associative array abstract data type, which may map keys to values. A hash table employs a hash function to generate an index, often referred to as a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots from which the necessary item may be retrieved.

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

(add)

Arguments: key, value

Returns: nothing

This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

(get)

Arguments: key

Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

(contains)

Arguments: key

Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

(hash)

Arguments: key

Returns: Index in the collection for that key

## Approach & Efficiency:
Time : O(1)

Space : O(1)
## API
(add)

Arguments: key, value

Returns: nothing

This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

(get)

Arguments: key

Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

(contains)

Arguments: key

Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

(hash)

Arguments: key

Returns: Index in the collection for that key
