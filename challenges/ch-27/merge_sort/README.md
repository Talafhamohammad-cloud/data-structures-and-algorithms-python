# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create function takes an array as an input and uses Merge Sort to sort it.
## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Recursive (divide-and-conquerre):

We break the problem into several sub-problems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size, solve the sub-problems recursively, and then combine these solutions to create a solution to the original problem
The merge sort algorithm is a recursive algorithm


## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
